# Creating Reusable Functions Lab

The purpose of this repository is to create reusable blocks of code with functions. 

## Description

I implemented array methods and practiced loops. The data consisted of an array of objects and I had to meet certain conditions in the lab exercises. For example, I implemented finding the sum using a loop and then again using a reducer function. I found the average of an array of numbers, found the longest string, filtered through an array and more.
